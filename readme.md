# An implementation of the A* Search Algorithm
### for solving 8-puzzle problem

### The initial state is:
7 4 5 <br>
2 * 6 <br>
8 3 1 <br>

### The goal state is
1 2 3 <br>
4 5 6 <br>
7 8 * <br>

### Usage:
```python node_a8.py```

+ The program prints each path of expansion until the goal state is found
+ Then it prints the optimal path in to reach the goal state
+ It outputs the algorithm to console as well as files ```optimal.txt``` and ```expansion.txt```
