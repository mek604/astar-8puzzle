# An implementation of the A* Search Algorithm
### for solving 8-puzzle problem

### The initial state is:
7 4 5
2 * 6
8 3 1

### The goal state is
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 *

### Usage:
```python node_a8.py```

+ The program prints each path of expansion until the goal state is found
+ Then it prints the optimal path in to reach the goal state
